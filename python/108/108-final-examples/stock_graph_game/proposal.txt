Final Project Proposal:

I want to build a small stock market simulator game. I will use canvas 
to generate a graph with somewhat predictable tendancies, then reveal 
part of the graph to the user. The user will have the option to SKIP, 
or BUY with 10,25,50 or 100 percent of the money they have. The rest of
the graph will be revealed in increments, and at each increment they may
either WAIT or SELL their stock. The goal will be to reach 1,000,000 dollars.
