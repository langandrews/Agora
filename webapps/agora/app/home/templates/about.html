          <p>Agora: Project Showcase is a repository of projects created by computer science students and faculty at Calvin College.</p>
          <p>These projects are hosted as examples of what students can expect to create in class or for fun while taking classes at Calvin College.</p>
          <p>Projects that are hosted on this page have been approved by the Computer Science department at Calvin College, but this does not mean that they are perfect.</p>
          <p>Many of these projects were made in the introductory computer science classes, and as such should not be held to the same standards as other software.</p>
          <p>If you have enjoyed looking at these projects or would like to know more, please visit the website for the <a href='cs.calvin.edu'>Computer Science Department at Calvin College</a>.</p>

          <p>Agora was begun in Fall 2015 by two senior computer science students, Drew Campo and Corwin Webster.</p>
          <p>The next fall, the project was revisited by two more senior computer science students, Joel Stehouwer and Andrew Lang.</p>
          <p>This is the BEST SENIOR PROJECT EVA!</p>
