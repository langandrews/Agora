For my final project I will make create a version of the snake game.
The user will be able to control the snake to make it move around
the screen and eat up its 'food'. As the snake eats more food it will
become longer and longer. The snake cannot run into itself. There will
be additional settings so the user can choose if the snake can go 
through the edges and come back around or if the game will end if it 
runs into the edge. Also there will settings to determine how fast 
the snake moves.
