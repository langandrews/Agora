Project proposal 

For my final project, I'd like to create a game of Othello.
I will create a green board with 64 squares, and users place black or white tokens on the board and try to do it in places that will win them the most tokens.
If one user's tokens are surrounded by the other's, the tokens will turn the second user's color. 
At the end of the game, points are added up, and the player with the most tokens of his color on the board wins.
