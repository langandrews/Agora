1. The template file is located in /home/Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/src/main/webapp/app/home/templates.
   It is called templatePage.html

2. Make a copy of this file in the same directory and name it whatever you want that seems appropriate as the page's name.

3. Edit the file /home/Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/src/main/webapp/app/index/config/indexRouteConfig.js, 
   adding another .when() block after the others, changing only the value for "bodyClassName" and the name of the html file. 
   Preferably, you should make the bodyClassName value the same as the name of the html file for the sake of consistency. 
   Save your changes.

4. Edit the file /home/Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/webapp/app/home/controllers/progListController.js. Add a new entry 
   to the $scope.progListItems dictionary/JSON object, using the "bodyClassName" value that you used previously as the key. 
   The value is an array of more dictionaries/JSON objects that each hold the necessary information of any programs on that subpage, 
   following the example of the preexisting entries, with the following possible data fields (required fields are preceded with a *):
     * id: a string containing the name of the file to be executed (if the project is many files, use the one that you would type 
      in the command line to run it yourself)
     * name: the name of the program that you want to show up on the webpage
     - details: a description of the program
     - image: Location of the thumbnail for the program ($scope.picturePath + "nameOfThumbnail.png"). 
      Put your thumbnail image in the /home/Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/src/main/webapp/images/ folder so that Angular can find your picture.
     - instructions: some instructions on how to use your program if necessary
     - author: name of the creator of the program
     - date: date added to the page

5. Edit your copied html file, looking for the three fields marked by **replaceThisText**. Replace these markers with the indicated information.

6. That's it! Enjoy your new subpage!
