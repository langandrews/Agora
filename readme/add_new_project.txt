1. Copy the new project into a new directory that is accessible to this computer,
   keeping note of the absolute reference to:
     - The main file or project executable which will be referred to as <executable>.
     - The directory where this project's files are stored which will be referred to as <directory>

2. Make note of the language that the program is written in.  This will be referred to as
   <language>.  The short form of this must also be known, this will be referred to as <lang>.
     - We recommend creating a <language> directory in the Agora base directory, and then
       placing all <language> projects in their own directories within this directory.
     - If this is the first project that is being added to Agora that uses <language>,
       follow the steps shown in 'Agora/readme/add_new_language.txt'

3. Determine the information that should be displayed on the webpage for this project.
   This information will be stored in 'Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/src/main/webapp/app/home/controllers/progListController.js'.
   This information is described below: (* means required, - means optional)
     * id: a string containing the name of the file to be executed (if the project is many files, use the one that you would type 
      in the command line to run it yourself)
     * name: the name of the program that you want to show up on the webpage
         This will be referred to as <display_name>
     - details: a description of the program
     - image: Location of the thumbnail for the program ($scope.picturePath + "nameOfThumbnail.png"). 
      Put your thumbnail image in the /home/Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole/src/main/webapp/images/ folder so that Angular can find your picture.
     - instructions: some instructions on how to use your program if necessary
     - author: name of the creator of the program
     - date: date added to the page
   By modifying this file, you will change which projects appear on the sub-pages.

4. Add the project to 'Agora/resources/project_listing.txt' using the following format.
   <display_name>,<directory>,<executable>,<lang>

5. Rebuild the project by running 'sudo ./builddeploy.sh' from the 'Agora/guacamole-client/guacamole' directory
