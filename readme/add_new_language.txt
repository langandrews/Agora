1. Install the required packages for the new language.

2. In 'Agora/scripts/start.sh', add a new if block for the new language.
     - If these projects run in a console, or use a console to run, we recommend including 
       a way to close access to the console when the project completes execution.  We
       accomplished this through the general format shown below.
       'xterm -fg white -bg black -e "bash -c \"clear; <run_the_executable>; read -n 1\"" &'
       This also creates the console window using a black background and white text so that it
       blends in nicely with the guacamole background.

3. We recommend creating a simple hello-world project using this language to test that
   the language was installed and runs correctly.
